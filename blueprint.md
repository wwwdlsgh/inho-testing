# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

A simple, visually appealing web application to generate random lottery numbers. The application will feature a clean, modern design and a straightforward user interface.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

*   **Layout:** A centered, single-column layout that is responsive and mobile-friendly.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant and energetic color scheme will be used.
*   **Typography:** Clear and readable fonts will be used, with a larger font size for the generated numbers.
*   **Visuals:** The generated numbers will be displayed in visually distinct "lotto ball" elements.
*   **Interactivity:** A button with a clear call-to-action will trigger the number generation. The button will have a subtle animation on hover and click.

### Features

*   **Number Generation:** Generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **Display:** Display the generated numbers clearly to the user.
*   **Web Component:** A custom web component (`lotto-ball`) will be used to display each number, demonstrating modern web development practices.

## Current Plan

*   **Task:** Create the initial version of the Lotto Number Generator.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Update `index.html` with the new structure for the lottery generator.
    2.  Update `style.css` with styles for the layout, lottery machine, and lotto balls.
    3.  Update `main.js` with the logic for generating random numbers and a web component for the lotto balls.
